# AfricasTalking Notifiers

HTTP service hosting callbacks for all AfricasTalking APIs.

## 1. SMS Callback Service

SMSs are sent from an application by making a HTTP POST request to the AfricasTalking SMS API. For each request AfricasTalking receives, they respond with a notification back indicating whether the sms transaction was successful or failed.

Other events AfricasTalking sends notifications for are;

- Whenever they receive a message for an application.
- When a user opts out of receiving messages from the alphanumeric code, sender id, or if they subscribe/unsubscribe from the premium SMS service.

To receive these notifications you need to setup a callback URL depending on the type of notification you would like to receive. SMS API notifications are sent for various SMS categories as shown below:

### 1.1 Delivery Reports
